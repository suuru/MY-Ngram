# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
we are to write a program my_ngram that will count the number of occurrences per character.

## Description
In computational linguistics and probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles.

## Installation
This will take a while to explain, because I'm still trying to understand myself

## Usage
This code is a simple program that counts the number of occurrences of each character in a string input.

The string input is taken as a command-line argument, which means that the user can pass the input string as an argument when running the program. The input string is stored in the input array, which is initialized to an empty string. The code then concatenates the command-line arguments into the input array using a loop and the strcat function.

Next, the program declares an array counts with 256 elements, which will be used to store the count of each character in the input string. The program then counts the number of occurrences of each character in the input string by iterating through each character in the string and incrementing the corresponding element in the counts array.

Finally, the program prints out the count of each character by iterating through the counts array and printing the character and its count if the count is greater than zero.
